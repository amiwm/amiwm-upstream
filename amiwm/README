1. Intro

This is amiwm, an X window manager that tries to make your workstation
look like an Amiga®.  "Why?" you ask.  Because I wanted it to.  So there!

2. Compiling etc.

For instructions on building and installing, read the file INSTALL.

3. Configuration

amiwm reads the file .amiwmrc in the directory pointed to by $HOME
when starting.  If this file does not exist, it reads the file
system.amiwmrc instead.

The configuration file can contain any of the following statements:

FastQuit {yes|no}

Specifies whether amiwm should quit directly when the Quit menu item
is selected, rather than popping up a requester.
(on/off or true/false can be used instead of yes/no.)

SizeBorder {right|bottom|both|none}

Specifies which border should be enlarged when a sizegadget is present.

ForceMove {manual|auto|always}

Enables you to move windows outside the perimeter of the root window
when pressing shift, when trying to drag at least 25% of the window
ofscreen, or always, respectively.

IconDir "path"

Specifies a directory in which amiwm will look for icons.

DefaultIcon "name"

Gives the filename of the .info file to use as a default icon.
It is relative to the IconDir.

IconPalette {system|magicwb}

Selects either the Workbench® default palette, or the MagicWorkbench
standard palette for use with icons.

ScreenFont "fontname"

Selects a font to use for windowtitles etc.

IconFont "fontname"

Selects a font for icontitles.

{detailpen|blockpen|textpen|shinepen|shadowpen|fillpen|filltextpen|
	backgroundpen|highlighttextpen|bardetailpen|barblockpen|
	bartrimpen} "colorname"

Modifies the colour scheme for the window manager.

ToolItem "name" "command"

Adds an item in the Tools menu with the specified name, which executes
the command when selected.

4. Troubleshooting

The most likely reason for the windowmanager to crash is if it
can't find its default icon, or if this is not accepted as an
.info file.  If this happens, amiwm _will_ dump core.  So make
sure that either 'make install' runs successfully (in which case
amiwm will know where its icon is), or that the file .amiwmrc
contains a correct specification of the icon's location.

Don't mail me bug reports just because amiwm prints "Bad Window" on
stderr once in a while.  Redirect it to /dev/null or live with it.  :)
